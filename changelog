## TODO ##

Add pages:


	list of Followers
	list of following
	list of all users
	list of all posts
	list of all posts of users you are following


Make these pages look nicer:
	post single
	upload post page
	edit profile page


Concepts to maybe add after main project is finished:

	ability to clear url

	likes(hearts) for posts
		likes(hearts) count per profile
		each post has heart count and links to who hearted the post

	edit post

	delete post
